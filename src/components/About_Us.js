            OUR CORPORATE STORY
            We are a global tech-based credit banking company. We believe knowledge,
             technology and students coming together brings progress. Our unique outlook
             transforms knowledge, students, and future tech companies into insights to power 
            decision makers that move people forward.
            
            We serve as a consumer advocate, steward of financial literacy, and champion of economic 
            advancement. As an innovative global company that enables access to credit, we’re part of
             breakthrough collaborations, breaking down barriers and innovations that address complex
             social challenges such as social welfare, community relations and financial education for
             underprivileged youth, tech students and future and budding tech companies. We finance 
            relationships that create economically healthy communities. We help individuals gain financial
             independence by increasing access to capital for small businesses. And we provide young adults 
            entering college or university and startup tech companies with financial education tools.
            
            Every day, around the globe, we are Powering the World with Knowledge and helping people 
            live their financial best. 
            
            Values: Our people are at the heart of our success. What we believe and how we act are at 
            the core of how we will deliver on our purpose to help people live their financial best.
            
            How do we operate?
            * HeYau DeKredit accepts applications for funding for credit and verifies credit scores. 
            WE offer priority offered to students and small tech companies not from credit score but, 
            from a burning desire to serve with technology.
